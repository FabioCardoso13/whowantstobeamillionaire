Initial goals:
	
	Code a game of questions and answears, with helps.
What the program consists of:

The game I developed is called “Quem quer ser milionário” and it is a questions and answers game developed in Python. The goal of the game is to answer questions and advance through various difficulty levels, with the aim of reaching the final level. The game includes features such as helps, with the possibility to eliminate incorrect answers options, call someone and the possibility to ask the audience for help. It saves all questions and answers given from the most recent game in a file called “WhoWantsToSerMillionaire.txt”.
The game is based on the television show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”.

Difficulties:

Throughout the development of the game, I faced some difficulties, one of them being minimizing code repetition. However, due to the need to use multiple loops in the code, a solution could not be found. I tried to develop methods but the methods do not recognize “break” because it is not contained in a loop. We tried to solve the same with “returns” but I was not successful.
